#On Par Challenge
The point of the On Par Challenge is to assess each student's current coding and problem solving abilities. Each student will receive one of two ratings based on the successful completion of each problem. To receive a rating of On Par (meaning the student is progressing at a satisfactory rate), all requirements of both problems must be completely met. If all requirements are not met for both problems, the student will receive a rating of "Not On Par" (meaning the student is not progressing at a satisfactory rate).

The On Par Challenge must be completed and submitted at or before 8:55 PM (end of class). Students are required to work independently. The challenge is open note, but students are not permitted to share code or communicate in anyway with one another. Students are not permitted to receive help from instructors or TAs during the assessment.

##Problem 1
[Example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5A2Jb7LrKtqWVpteU83LWU3Ujg/view)
Create a program that asks the user for integers. Print to the console all integers that have been entered and the sum of the integers. The integers should be entered one at a time.

Your program should:
- [ ] (1) Ask the user for 1 number.
- [ ] (2) Print the number and the current sum.
- [ ] (3) Ask the user if he/she would like to enter another number.
- [ ] (4) If the user enters "YES", steps 1-3 should be repeated until the user does not enter "YES".
  - [ ] (4a) When step 2 is repeated, all numbers that have been entered should print, not just the current number entered.
  - [ ] (4b) User's "YES" response should be case insensitive.
- [ ] (5) If the user enters "NO" (case insensitive), print "GOODBYE..." and the program should end.

##Problem 2
[Example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5A2Jb7LrKtqWm1GQi1GRldVMW8/view)
Create a program that asks the user for 2 numbers and an arithmetic operation to perform on the 2 numbers. Operations should include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Print to the console the result of the operation. The program should repeat until the user enters "NO".

Your program should:
- [ ] (1) Ask the user for 2 numbers.
- [ ] (2) Ask the user for the operation to be performed.
- [ ] (3) Print the result of the operation.
- [ ] (4) Ask the user if he/she would like to do another calculation.
- [ ] (4) If the user enters "YES", steps 1-3 should be repeated until the user does not enter "YES".
  - [ ] (4a) User's "YES" response should be case insensitive.
- [ ] (5) If the user enters "NO" (case insensitive), print "GOODBYE..." and the program should end.
